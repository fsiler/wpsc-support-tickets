== Description ==

Support tickets are critical to most businesses that provide a product or service, 
and is often used for clients, customers, members, authors, sponsors, pre-sale questions and more.   
[wpsc Support Tickets](http://wpstorecart.com/wpsc-support-tickets/ "wpsc Support Tickets") is an open source Wordpress support ticket system.  
This isn't some port of another ticket system that's been hacked to run inside Wordpress.  This is a new plugin designed from the ground up specifically for Wordpress.

While completely optional, wpsc Support Tickets can work in unison with [wpStoreCart](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wpstorecart/ "wpStoreCart"), an open source ecommerce plugin for Wordpress.
This can optionally allow you to keep your support ticket system accessible only to paying customers and/or current members.
